a. Overview:

* Purpose: The product will scan container images for known vulnerabilities and show the user which images need fixing.
* Target Audience: Developers or security personnel managing container images in repositories.
  
b. Problem Statement:
* Containers contain applications and dependencies that may have vulnerabilities. It's hard to manage thousands of images manually, so you need a tool to identify and prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities.

c. User Stories:
* "As a user, I need to see which container images have critical vulnerabilities so I can prioritize them for fixes."
* "As a user, I need to filter vulnerabilities by severity so I can focus on the most dangerous issues first."

d. Features:
* Vulnerability Scanning: Scans container images for known security vulnerabilities.
* Severity Classification: Classifies vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* Dashboard: Provides an overview of scanned images and their vulnerability status.
* Filtering: Allows the user to filter vulnerabilities by severity and image.
* Remediation Tracking: Lets users track which vulnerabilities have been fixed or need attention.

e. UI Requirements:
Dashboard: Displays overall vulnerability status with actionable insights.
* Image Detail Pages: Shows a list of vulnerabilities with detailed info.
* Actions: Options to mark vulnerabilities fixed and filter vulnerabilities by severity.

f. Technical Requirements:
* The product should integrate with vulnerability databases like CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
* Should allow integration with CI/CD pipelines for automatic scanning.
